## About me.
   > I graduated from  Belarusian-Russian University in 2011 as a road construction engineer. When I was still in school, I started programming. I wrote programs in Delphi, but I went to the Construction Faculty. Besides, when I was at the university, I also wrote programs. So, all of this made it easier for me to study at university. Oddly enough, I wrote my thesis in C#. Currently, I work as head of the production and technical department at a construction company. Unfortunately, I don't like my job, although I do it well. I would like to become an IT specialist.
   
## My strengths.
   > I can describe myself as a responsible and hardworking person.  In my work I constantly write programs and scripts that simplify my life. Likewise, I also believe that I am a fast learner and absorb new information quickly. I see my strength as the ability to find extraordinary ways to get out of difficult situations. I am always optimistic about the world, and I try to treat problems the same way. They do not scare me, but on the contrary, mobilize me. My motto is: "Laziness is the source of my inspiration." When I'm lazy to do something, I try to automate this task as much as possible.
   
## My programming skills.  
   > During my life, I have tried a lot to write in different programming languages, use different technologies, such as: Object Pascal, C #, PHP, MySQL, JS, VBA, write Android applications, and so on. But I didnâ€™t master any programming language or technology, because I did a little bit of everything. So I couldn't  determine what I still wanted to do. Create programs or sites. Create backend sites or their frontend. Each time I realized that my English level is very poor, while I need English to draw up-to-date information from primary sources. Besides, my main task also didn't allow me to spend much time on my hobby - programming. I recently  created some simple websites to help my wife do her college studies. Moreover, I realized that I still want to be a front-end developer,  and in the future I can master the backend, for example, in PHP.
In summary, I have started to improve my English level, although I still find it difficult to understand both verbal communication and speaking fluently.
